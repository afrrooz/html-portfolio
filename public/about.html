<h1>About myself</h1>
<h2>My name is Mohammed Afroz</h2>
<hr>
<p>I am 22 years old. As of now i am purseving my masters in computer Application. <br> I have decided to make my future as a web developer (Inshallah) <br> everyone must have a dream or aim to get achieve in our live, <br> having a dream job is tuff nowadays but in islam everything is possible <br> if you believe it is possible for you so your work is to do hard work <br> and keep trying until you get suceed in your life. </p>
<p>I have completed my ssc in 2016, my intermediate in 2018, and my graduation in 2020.</p>
<p>As i'm now 22 years, after my graduation my age is 20 years, <br> everyone thinks that after graduation it is compulsory that one can start doing a work <br> and it is right because if you start working something which gonna help you to grow in future then one can start work </p>
<p> but i decided to go to abroad for my masters but my intension is to go abroad and start earning <br> because you get more than here. I have written exams for its minimum requirement, <br> but i failed both the times.
</p>
<p>I was totaly involved in that i will go and work there and not thinking about my family current situation. <br> Later i have decided after wasting one year that i should continue my studies. <br> and i have taken risk change my subject and i have started form the beginning.</p>
<p>Today's generation there's a lot of competion in almost every where. <br> the one who now doing something he started it far before and now he got a chance to do something.</p>
<p>Remember one thing the one who decided to do something and have believe in himself and he is in consistency <br> <strong>one day he will get me success</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alhamdulillah Allah subhan wa t'ala gave me more than what i deserve <br> </strong></p>
<p>One day i want to make my parents proud of his son (Inshallah)</p>
